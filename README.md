QCRoadBot is a Twitter bot created to search for highways in Quebec with difficult driving conditions due to snow and/or ice accumulation.

The project will be developed in different phases:

1 - Main functionality: Web scrapping to search road with difficult drive conditions. For roads with ice and/or snow cumulation a tweet will be posted. 

2 - Weather forecast: Tweet weather forecast by region when there’s a reasonable chance of precipitation.

3 - Responsive bot: Transform the bot so it can respond to users request. For example, if you want to know if there’s difficult driving conditions on a specific highway, you could tweet a message like “Autoroute 10“ and bot would search for the driving conditions and reply back to the user with a tweet.

4 - Augmented functionality:  Include other types of alerts. For example, roads with hindrances.
